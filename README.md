# Technoblade Never Dies
A personal client-side mod made for remembering the Minecraft YouTuber
[Technoblade](https://technoblade.ccom), who passed away from Sarcoma cancer recently.

If you want, feel free to fork this and make your own version to add on things, as I
will not release this publicly via CurseForge or Modrinth, and will only be updated
at my own leisure.

## Features
- Pigs get a crown on their heads if they're renamed to Technoblade.
- Pigs will start saying "bruh" if they're renamed to Technoblade.
- The Minecraft title text gets changed to a "Technoblade Never Dies" text (made by [MrBrose_](https://twitter.com/MrBrose_))
- Custom splash texts
